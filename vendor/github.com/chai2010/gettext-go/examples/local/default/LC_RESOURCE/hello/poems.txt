Drinking Alone Under the Moon
Li Bai

flowers among one jar liquor
alone carouse without mutual intimate

raise cup greet bright moon
facing shadow become three persons

moon since not free to-drink
shadow follow accompany my body

briefly accompany moon with shadow
go happy should avail-oneself-of spring

my song moon walk-to-and-fro irresolute
my dance shadow fragments disorderly

sober time together mix glad
drunk after each divide scatter

eternal connect without consciouness-of-self roam
mutual appointment remote cloud Milky-Way
